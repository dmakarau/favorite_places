# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

## Context

The Flutter application initially had business logic mixed with UI components, making it difficult to maintain, test, and scale. HTTP requests were directly embedded in widget files, and there was no clear separation of concerns.

## Decision

We will implement Clean Architecture principles with the following structure:

- **Service Layer**: Business logic and external API integration
- **Provider Layer**: State management using Riverpod
- **UI Layer**: Pure UI components with minimal logic
- **Model Layer**: Data structures and entities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Better maintainability
- Easier to onboard new developers
- Scalable architecture for future features

### Negative
- Initial learning curve for team members
- More files and directories to manage
- Slight increase in code complexity for simple operations

## Implementation

```
lib/
├── services/           # Business logic
├── providers/          # State management  
├── widgets/           # UI components
├── screens/           # Screen composition
└── models/            # Data structures
```

## Alternatives Considered

1. **MVC Pattern**: Too coupled for Flutter's reactive nature
2. **BLoC Pattern**: Overkill for current app complexity
3. **Provider Only**: Insufficient separation for business logic

## Decision Drivers

- Need for better testability
- Requirement for maintainable code
- Preparation for team scaling
- Industry best practices alignment
